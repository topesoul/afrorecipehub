- **Recipe to Comments**: A recipe can have multiple comments associated with it.

### One-to-One Relationships

- **Recipe to Category**: Each recipe belongs to a single category.

## Usage

### User Registration and Authentication

- Users can register by providing a username, email, and password.
- Passwords are securely hashed using Flask-Bcrypt before being stored in the database.
- After registering, users can log in to access personalized features like creating recipes, commenting, and bookmarking.

### Recipe Management

- Logged-in users can create new recipes, including uploading images, adding ingredients, and writing step-by-step instructions.
- Users can edit or delete their own recipes from their dashboard.
- Recipes can be viewed by all users, with filtering options to help users find specific dishes.

### Commenting and Bookmarking

- Users can leave comments on recipes to engage with other users.
- Recipes can be bookmarked for easy access later from the userâ€™s dashboard.

### Admin Controls

- Admins have the ability to edit or delete any user-generated content, including recipes and comments, directly from the user interface.
- Admins can manage user accounts to ensure the community remains positive and focused on its culinary mission.

## Security Features

### Environment Configuration

- **Environment Variables:** All sensitive data, such as Flask configuration keys and MongoDB URIs, are stored in environment variables. This ensures that sensitive information is not hardcoded into the application and can be easily managed in different deployment environments.

### User Authentication and Authorization

- **Registration:** Passwords are hashed using Flask-Bcrypt before storing in the database, ensuring that passwords are not stored in plain text. Unique usernames and emails are enforced to prevent duplicate accounts.

- **Login:** User login is secured by checking the hashed password against the stored hash using Flask-Bcrypt. Session management is handled securely, with session cookies being set to HttpOnly to prevent JavaScript access.

- **Access Control:** Access to certain routes is restricted to authenticated users only using the @login_required decorator. Admins have additional privileges controlled via session variables (is_admin).

### Data Validation and Sanitization

- **User Input Validation:** Inputs are validated both client-side (via forms) and server-side (in Flask routes). Data is sanitized before being processed to prevent injection attacks.

### File Upload Handling

- **File Security:** Uploaded files are securely stored using secure_filename from Werkzeug to prevent directory traversal attacks. Profile images are removed if the user deletes their account, ensuring no residual data is left.

### Session Management

- **Secure Sessions:** Flask's session cookies are used with a secure SECRET_KEY. Session data is cleared upon user logout, and sessions are securely managed to prevent hijacking.

### Access Control

- **Role-Based Access:** Route access is controlled via user roles, with certain routes restricted to admins only. Users cannot modify or delete accounts other than their own unless they are admins.

### Error Handling

- **Graceful Error Handling:** Errors are handled gracefully, with appropriate flash messages displayed to the user. Internal errors are logged for further investigation.
  Logging and Monitoring

- **Operation Logging:** All critical operations are logged, and logs are monitored for suspicious activities. Logs do not contain sensitive information like passwords or API keys.

## API Integration

AfroRecipeHub features API endpoints designed to enhance the user experience. One notable API endpoint retrieves the current user's points balance and updates the frontend in real-time, providing instant feedback as users interact with the platform. This is a great example of how the platform blends backend functionality with a dynamic user interface to keep users engaged and informed.

## Testing
